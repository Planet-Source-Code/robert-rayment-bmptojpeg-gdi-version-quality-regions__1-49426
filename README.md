### Description

BmpToJpeg GDI+ version (Quality & Regions) by Robert Rayment. Converts bmp to jpeg. See effect of quality before saving. Selected regions can be of a different quality. Regions can be rectangle, rounded rectangle, oval or lasso. It appears that there are intermittent problems with ijl15.dll and Win2K. So this prog has used cut, paste & adapted code from Carles P V (CodeId=42376) & MrBoBo (CodeId=42488) for GDI+ which, if you haven't got it, can be downloaded at - www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?releaseid=32738 - Install gdiplus.dll in your system or app folder. (Exe tested on XP Home) Win 2K, Win 98, Zip 241 KB (Couple of bmps included).
